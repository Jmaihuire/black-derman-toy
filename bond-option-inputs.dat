# Format of input file is as follows.
  A comment of this form (any number of lines of text with
  a hash sign at the beginning of the first line and
  another hash sign at the end of the last line) is allowed
  before every block of inputs.
  In this file, these comments are used to document the
  sequence of inputs for a bond option.

  The first input is the No of Lattice Points     	#
300
#   Next come the desired Outputs (1: Desired, 0: Not Desired)
    a) Input Data.                       b) Yield Curve
    c) LatticePointWise Yield Curve      d) Yield Curve Detailed Diagnostics
    e) Full Lattice.                     f) Final Results.
    For LatticePointWise Yield Curve, n > 1 for every nth point  #
1 1 0 1 0 1
#   Bond Maturity: Years, Days  #
3  0
#   Coupon Rate, Frequency#
10 1 
#   Redemption Value               #
100
#   Short Rate and its Volatility in Percent  #
10 20
#   a) Yield Curve Type: 0 for Zero, 1 for Par Bond
    b) Volatilty Curve Type:   0 for none (fixed sigma)
                               1 Zero
                               2 Par Bond
    c) No of points on yield/volatility curves #
0 1 5
#   Yield Curve                 #
1 10   20
2 11   19
3 12   18
4 12.5 17
5 13   16
#   Minimum Local Volatility #
0 
#   While attempting to match the yield and volatility curve, it
    may be desired to put greater weight on yield curve. If so provide
    a number greater than 1 below #
.5 
#   Often the Yield Curve is a risk free yield curve and the bond
    may need to be discounted by adding a Credit Spread to the Yield Curve.
    If so provide the spread in percent below #
0
#   Is this a bond option or embedded option?
    0 for bond option
    1 for embedded option  #
0
#   Exercise Price of bond option  	#
95
#   Time to Maturity of bond option	#
2
#   Earliest exercise time of the option 
    0 for American option
    maturity for European option #
2
#   Is the option a put or a call
    Put = 0
    Call = 1 		#
0
